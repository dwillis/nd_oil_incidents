# nd_oil_incidents
This is some sample code that we used in reporting on environmental incidents involving the North Dakota oil industry.

See http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/23/us/north-dakota-oil-boom-downside.html.

I would never argue that this code is the best code ever, but it worked for us and might help other reporters who want a rough idea of how one might approach stories that involve scraping and parsing.
